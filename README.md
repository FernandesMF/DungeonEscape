# DungeonEscape
A simple escape the room game, made with Unreal Engine 4. It was one of the projects in a game development
course that I was taking.

If you are interested in playing it, you just have to create its intermediate files with the UE4.
You will need the Medieval Dungeon pack, which is available for free in its Marketplace.
